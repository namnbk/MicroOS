Step1: This directory contains the core files constituting the kernel.
------ The kernel must be compiled using the following commands:

$ cd kernel
$ gcc -nostdinc -march=i386 -g -n -nostdlib -nostartfiles -nodefaultlibs -Wall -I../common *.c ../common/*.c -e_start -Ttext=0x7e00 -o kernel

Step2 : The above command generates a debuggable version of the
------  kernel.  However, a raw computer without any OS cannot run the kernel.
        You need to extract just the executable part along with
        necessary data using the objcopy command as shown below:

$ objcopy -S -j.text -j.rodata -j.data -O binary kernel KERNEL.BIN

The above command extracts the kernel into a pure binary file called
KERNEL.BIN (file size: 13312 bytes)

Step 3: The next step involves copying muos_empty.img to muos.img to
------  create a useable floppy image.  Perform this task using the cp
        command as shown below (assumes you are in the kernel directory):

$ cp ../muos_empty.img ../muos.img

Step 4: Copy the kernel to the clean muos.img file using the mcopy
------- command in the following manner (assumes you are in the kernel
        directory):

$ mcopy -i ../muos.img KERNEL.BIN ::

Ensure that the file has been copied using the mdir command as shown
below (along with output)

$ mdir -i ../muos.img ::
 Volume in drive : has no label
 Volume Serial Number is 265D-AFC5
Directory for ::/

KERNEL   BIN     13312 2007-02-13  23:36
        1 file               13 312 bytes
                          1 444 352 bytes free

Step 5: Copy any other files and utility programs (such as shell and
------- all executables in the bin directory) to the floppy image
        (muos.img) using the mcopy command (shown above).  A typical
	muos image typically has the following files:

$ mdir -i ../muos.img ::
 Volume in drive : has no label
 Volume Serial Number is 265D-AFC5
Directory for ::/

KERNEL   BIN     13312 2007-02-13  23:36
SHELL    BIN      2156 2007-02-13  23:39
HELLO    BIN       556 2007-02-13  23:39
CLEAR    BIN       382 2007-02-13  23:39
        4 files              16 406 bytes
                          1 440 256 bytes free
