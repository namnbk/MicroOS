   \brief A simple FAT12 (floppy) file system driver (read only).

   This header file provides a set of forward declarations for the
   different data structures and API methods that the FAT12 driver
   supports for reading data from a FAT12 file system.

   \note These functions are internally used by the OS.  An
   application program should never call these functions directly.
