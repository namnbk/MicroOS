/** \file Process.h

    \brief Segment memory and manage process(s).

    This file provides a set of of prototypes for functions that
    perform the following tasks:

    <UL>

    <LI> The \c initializeProcesses() function breaks the memory into
    logical blocks of 32KB.  It then initializes the ProcessTable with
    default entries.  The first 2 32KB blocks are typically used use
    by the kernel. </LI>

    <LI> Each logical block is associated with a Process and
    information regarding each process is stored in the ProcessInfo
    datastructure defined in this file.  An array of ProcessInfo
    datastructures constitute the ProcessTable data structure. </LI>

    <LI> The \c allocateMemory() function must be used to allocate a
    free chunk of memory if one is available.  </LI>

    <LI> The \c deallocateMemory() function must be used to deallocate
    a previously allocated chunk of memory. </LI>

    Refer to the details of each one of the functions and data
    structures for further information.

    This enumeration defines the various states through which a

    <LI> \c UNUSED_PROCESS : This status incdicates that the process
    entry in the memory is not really used and is free to be used to
    load another process into memory.  Initialy the MemoryManager
    creates a set of process entries and set's their status to this
    value.</LI>

    <LI> \c PROCESS_STARTING: This status indicates that the kernel is
    in the process of loading this process into memory.  While the
    kernel is loading this process into memory it cannot be run nor
    can the memory be used for other purposes. </LI>

    <LI> \c PROCESS_BLOCKED: This status indicates that the process
    cannot be run right now as it is blocked waiting for some kind of
    I/O to be completed.  </LI>

    <LI> \c PROCESS_READY: This status indicates that the process is
    ready for using some CPU time but is currently not running because
    some other process (or the kernel) is using the CPU. </LI>
    
    <LI> \c PROCESS_RUNNING: This status indicates the process is
    actively running using the CPU. </LI>

    <LI> \c PROCESS_STOPPING: This status indicates that the kernel is
    in the process of shutting down this process.  </LI>

    \brief Structure containing information about a process.

    This structure holds all the information needed by the kernel to
    effectively handle operations of a process.  This structure
    contains the following fields:

    <OL>

    <LI>\c pIndex: The constant index of this process entry in the
    process table.  This value is actually used to compute the default
    initial segment register (cs, ds, es, and ss) values for the
    process during initialization and process creation.  This value is
    set when the ProcessTable is created and is never changed. </LI>
    
    <LI>\c pID: A logical process ID associated with this process.
    The process ID is set each time a new process is created by the
    createProcess() function in Process.h </LI>

    <LI>\c ppID: The process ID of the parent process that created this
    process.  This value is set each time a new process is created by
    the createProcess() function in Process.h </LI>

    <LI>\c pStatus: The current status of the process.  This value is one
    of the predefined constant values defined in this header file. </LI>

    <LI>\c pSP: The stack pointer value saved for this process so that
    it can be restored after operations or a context switch. </LI>

    <LI> \c pSS: The stack segement value saved for this process so that
    it can be restored after kernel operations or a context
    switch. </LI>

    <LI> \c keyBuffer: An array used to buffer keystrokes for this
    process when the user types on the keyboard and the process is not
    yet ready to read or process them. </LI>

    <LI> \c keyEntry: Location of the next free entry in the keyBuffer
    where the next charachter can be stored.  This value is
    initialized to 0 to indicate the buffer is empty.  It is
    incremented each time user types a key by the keyboard ISR.  It
    never exceeds KEY_BUFFER_SIZE.  It is decremented each time the
    application reads data from the buffer. </LI>

    <LI> \c name: The file name from where the process information was
    loaded into memory. </LI>
