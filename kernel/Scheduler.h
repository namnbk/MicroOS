   purpose registers of the current process on to the current

/** \def CRITICAL_SECTION

    \brief Wrap a piece of C code in a critial section.

    This macro is used to wrap sections of C programs in a critical
    section.  A critical section is a piece of code that is guaranteed
    not to be interrupted (unless fatal errors occur) during normal
    operation.  Note that this macro preserves the values of the
    flags.  Consequently, if interrupts were previously disabled, they
    continue to remain in disabled state.

    This macro achieves a critical section in the following manner:

    <OL>

    <LI> First it saves the status of the interrupt flag on the stack
    using the \c pushfw instruction. </LI>

    <LI> It disables interrupt processing using the \c cli
    instruction </LI>

    <LI> It then embeds the statements passed in as the parameter.
    These statements must run very fast and not consume much CPU time.
    Furthermore this code must not block for any reason.  </LI>

    <LI> Once the code has run, it restores the state of the interrupt
    flag by simply popping the value of the flags off the stack. </LI>

    </OL>
